# Streamlit and OpenCV
<sub>*Machine Learning Engineer</sub>

This is an initial project with streamlit and opencv for building a Data App for image editing. 
This is a study of these technologies in order to create a basis for more robust applications, despite following the standard defined by PEP8 the code has not been optimized (feel free to do so). 
Anyway, I hope that this brief study of these libraries will assist in the development of more robust tools for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in general. 
If you can, please contribute and share your knowledge.
